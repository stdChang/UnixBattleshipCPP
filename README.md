# UnixBattleshipCPP
A recreation of the Battleship Game, created with C++ with a heavy emphasis on object oriented programming theory. Has a versus Player and versus AI game mode. The AI also contains 3 ranks of difficulty if you want to have a little fun. This was created over the course of several weeks during June 2021.
